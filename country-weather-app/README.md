Practice using useEffect Hook, Axios
Practing fetching data from server. Fetched data from Country API and Weather API to allow users to search for countries and have country info and weather displayed.

Search results are rendered conditionally, max 10 will be shown at a time, if one country is selected, its details will be displayed. 
When countries are shown, clicking the button beside them will display the data for that country

At this time I have not styled the app as the focus of the project is using React for functionality.
